## Overview of the Task

The task at hand is to create a simple React application that demonstrates your skills with ReactJS. The application consists of three components: Component A, Component B, and Component C. Component A acts as the parent component, while Component B and Component C are its child components.

## Task Description

### Component A

Component A serves as the main parent component and acts as the entry point of the application. It is responsible for rendering Component B and Component C.

### Component B

Component B is a child component of Component A. It includes an input text field that allows users to enter text. This component is responsible for listening to changes in the input field. Whenever a change event occurs, the value entered in the input field is stored in the Redux store.

### Component C

Component C is another child component of Component A. Its purpose is to retrieve the value stored in the Redux store and display it within the component. Component C will dynamically update whenever the value in the Redux store changes.

## Tech Stack

To accomplish this task, the following technologies and libraries are used:

- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux Toolkit: A library that simplifies the usage of Redux by providing abstractions and utilities.
- Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
